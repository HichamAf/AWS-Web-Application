# AWS Web Application

I crafted a basic web application, employing five distinct AWS services: Amplify, Lambda, IAM, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. 

Throughout this project, I gained invaluable insights into the specific use cases for these services and honed my ability to seamlessly integrate them. Each service was meticulously constructed, culminating in a fully operational math web application.
